RoyalCommands is a general plugin with lots of commands. Yeah, that's my description. Go look at the [BukkitDev](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/royalcommands) if you want a better one.

RoyalCommands is coded in IntelliJ with the following libraries:

 * Bukkit
 * CraftBukkit
 * Vault
 * VanishNoPacket
 * Multiverse-Core
 * TagAPI
 * WorldGuard
 * LWC

 2. Code submitted should not have a column limit or linebreaks mid-statement.

RoyalCommands
=============

RoyalCommands is a set of commands made for primary use on my server (RoyalCraft, royalcraf.tk), with many suggestions coming from my staff.

I am very much open for new command ideas.

RoyalCommands is coded in Eclipse 7.0.1 with the follwing libraries:

 * bukkit-1.0.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT.jar (1054)
 * craftbukkit-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (1559)
 * PermissionsEx.jar (optional, I should think)

RoyalCommands has no config file, as I don't think it needs one. Feel free to contact me if you would like to see one implemented.

![RoyalCommands](http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/36/432/royalcommands_5.png)

RoyalCommands is a general plugin with lots of commands. Yeah, that's my description. Go look at the [BukkitDev](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/royalcommands) if you want a better one.

RoyalCommands is coded in Eclipse 3.7.1 with the following libraries:

 * Bukkit
 * Vault
 * VanishNoPacket

### Bleeding Edge Builds

Changes pushed to GitHub will be auto-compiled on [Jenkins](http://royalcraftci.no-ip.org).

### About the developer

My name is Kyle Clemens. I run a cracked [Minecraft server](http://royaldev.org) at royaldev.org, write (currently) four different plugins: RoyalCommands, RoyalChat, RoyalMessages, and RoyalMisc.
RoyalMisc is only available on RoyalCraft.

I currently attend school and hope to continue learning Java to better this plugin.

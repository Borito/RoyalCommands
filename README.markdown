=============

![RoyalCommands](http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/36/432/royalcommands_5.png)

RoyalCommands is a general plugin with lots of commands. Yeah, that's my description. Go look at the [BukkitDev](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/royalcommands) if you want a better one.

RoyalCommands is coded in IntelliJ with the following libraries:

 * Bukkit
 * CraftBukkit
 * Vault
 * VanishNoPacket
 * Multiverse-Core
 * TagAPI
 * WorldGuard
 * LWC

 2. Code submitted should not have a column limit or linebreaks mid-statement.
 3. Code should follow UNIX linebreaks: i.e. LF only.
 4. Extra whitespace, especially at the end of lines, is frowned upon.
 5. Please compile and test your changes before requesting them to be merged.

### About the developer

My name is Kyle Clemens. I run a cracked [Minecraft server](http://royaldev.org) at royaldev.org, write (currently) four different plugins: RoyalCommands, RoyalChat, RoyalMessages, and RoyalMisc.
RoyalMisc is only available on RoyalCraft.

I currently attend school and hope to continue learning Java to better this plugin.

      Welcome to the documentation for RoyalCommands. The <a href="/commands">Commands</a> page houses every command in
      RoyalCommands and is automatically updated when changes are made to the plugin. <a href="/formats">Formats</a>
      contains the various formats that are accepted as arguments for commands. Finally, <a href="/signs">Signs</a> has
      the signs that can be created with RoyalCommands (but it is currently not completed).

```/deafen``` toggles the state of being "deaf" on the sender or ```(player)``` if specified, so long as the sender has
```rcmds.others.deafen``` and ```(player)``` does not have ```rcmds.exempt.deafen```.

If a player is "deaf," he will not receive any player chat messages, but will still receive plugin messages.

### Examples 

```/deafen``` - Toggles deaf status on the sender.  
```/deafen Notch``` - Toggles deaf status on ```Notch```.

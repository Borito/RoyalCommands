```/nick``` is a command that allows for players and administrators to manage nicknames.

### Examples

**Setting a nickname**

```/nick -player jkcclemens -nick Developer``` – This would set ```jkcclemens```' nickname to ```Developer```

```/nick -p jkcclemens -n Developer``` – This does the same as the above example but uses shorter flags.

**Clearing a nickname**

```/nick -player jkcclemens -clear``` – This would clear ```jkcclemens```' nickname.

```/nick -p jkcclemens -c``` – This does the same as the above example but uses shorter flags.

If a component of RoyalCommands states that it supports *home format*, then it will use the format detailed below as an
argument.

### Examples

For a home belonging to the command sender, the name of the home can be used plainly by itself.

```/home mansion``` - Attempts to bring the command sender to their own home called ```mansion```.

However, for administrative functions, other players' homes can be accessed as well. This is done by using the player's
name, followed by a colon, followed by the player's home name.

```/home Notch:mansion``` - Attempts to bring the command sender to ```Notch```'s home called ```mansion```.

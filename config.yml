# Command cooldowns #
###

# command: cooldown (seconds)
# Works for any command. Vanilla, rCmds, or any other

  # Matches /home, /home hello, etc. Does not match /homes

# Note that this will apply a cooldown to EVERY teleport
# done, and not just the /tp command. Whether it be a

# The difference in processing times varies only slightly.
# H2 is usually ~1-2ms faster than YML.
# During my tests, YML took 5.905ms to load data, and H2

# Command cooldowns #
###

# command: cooldown (seconds)
# Works for any command. Vanilla, rCmds, or any other
# Even works for commands that don't exist
# Cooldowns must be registered under their names in plugin.yml
# e.g. /teleport, not /tp
# Basically, you can't register aliases under command_cooldowns
command_cooldowns:
  # Matches /home, /home hello, etc. Does not match /homes
  home: 25
  teleport: 20
  save-all: 5
# Should cooldowns match aliases (e.g. /teleport and /tp have the same cooldown)?
cooldowns_match_aliases: true

# Creates cooldowns for global teleports
# Note that this will apply a cooldown to EVERY teleport
# done, and not just the /tp command. Whether it be a
# plugin like NoCheat teleporting you back (!), or Towny
# spawns, it will apply the cooldown.
# 0 is off
global_teleport_cooldown: 0
